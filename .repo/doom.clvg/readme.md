- Completely self contained (Files are kept within the game folder. No need to install anything extra)  
- Comes prepacked with DOOM Shareware (1st episode included)  
- Compatible with retail version and OST  
- In games save and loads work fine, saves get saved to game folder.

**How to add the full retail version.**  
If you own the full retail version of DOOM. Copy the \`wad\` file from your retail version over to the \`DOOM\_1\_files\` folder within Hakchi DOOM.

You can either add this file in to the zip before dragging over to hakchi or you can ftp it directly to the console if you are running NAND. USB users can just go to the folder like above and add it in directly.
