Emulated System: Zram (Virtual Swap Compressed in Ram!)

NOTE: Hakchi2 CE 3.4.1 is absolutely required for this to work due to kernel version! (This Zram modification will be potentially integrated directly into future Hakchi2 CE revisions by default!)

Star Fox 64, as a test example...always crashes after you beat the 1st level!  Mario Kart 64 crashes, on average, every 30 Minutes.  Zram alots more optimal memory usage.  And, as a result, you are 99.7 percent less likely to encounter such crashes in N64 games that have been prone to such instances in the past!

PSP Games also get a nominal boost, and crash less!
